SpaceMan Project

Game Description 

SpaceMan Prjoect is a basic remake of Hangman.The provided code is a simple JavaScript-based word guessing game. It randomly selects a word from a predefined list ( "javascript," "python") and allows the player to guess the word one letter at a time.The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (8 in this case) before the game ends. t displays victory or defeat messages, and the player can type in a letter to make guesses.


Technology Used

HTML: The game has an HTML structure to define the user interface, including elements for displaying the hidden word and messages . It also includes input elements for the player to enter their guesses.

CSS: The CSS code starts with general styling rules for HTML and body elements.It sets the background color of the body to grey, the text color to white, the font family to Helvetica, and the font size to 40px. It also helped me make some styling changes to my button inputs .

JavaScript: The core of the game logic is implemented in JavaScript.JavaScript is used to handle user interactions, such as processing guesses, updating the hidden word, and displaying messages. It also handles the random selection of words from the predefined list and the game's win/loss conditions.


Coding Challenges


I couldn't get the code to work exactly how i wanted to, therefore theres minimal input validation.For some reason i wasn't able to add a tally of incorrect guesses to the game and i couldn't get the alphabet container to work, which would improve the overall user experience.


Next Steps: 

There's a couple of things I would like to improve from this game.

1.The code only allows the player to enter a single lowercase letter, but it does not display error messages if the input is invalid.

2.I could implement a larger word list, potentially with categories or themes in order to make the game more engaging.

3.Although my CSS file styles the game, the design is still quite basic. I would love to add a hangman that appears throughout the game as incorrect guesses are made. I'd also like to get the alphabet container to properly function.
